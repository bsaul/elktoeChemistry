# Introduction 

Bivalve shells are validated chronicles for some aspects of freshwater chemistry [CITATIONS]. Many of these studies are based on haphazardly sampled shells and few independent replicates. Our study is different in that we have shells acquired at shells and shells collected after 6 months to one year of exposure to one of two NC rivers. The rivers, the Tuckasegee and the Little Tennessee, are similar in XXX (the Tuckasegee flows in the Little Tennessee), but precipitous declines in the numbers of the critically endangered Appalachian Elktoe (*Alasmidonta raveneliana*) in the Little Tennessee have been observed in recent years.

Laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) is (in 2 - 3 sentences).

@jackson2003laser experimentally fed contaminated fish to banded water snakes and showed LA-ICP-MS on tail tissue and showed LA-ICP-MS was able to differentiate between treatments.

In this paper, we use LA-ICP-MS data from a randomized, controlled study to show that certain elements were (1) associated with the exposure to two NC rivers and (2) associated with morbidity and mortality in the critically endangered Appalachian Elktoe (*Alasmidonta raveneliana*). Eighty-two specimens were drawn from the Tuckasegee river. Ten were killed for baseline comparisons, and the remaining 72 were randomly assigned to 6 experimental sites (3 on each river). Seventy-two *Lampsilis faciola* specimens were taken from the XXX hatchery and were placed in a separate cage alongside the *A. raveneliana* as control specimens. The specimens were deposited at each site in April XXXX. The *A. rav* were pulled six months later. Some of the *L. fas* were pulled at the same time, while the remaining were extracted the following spring. At least one LA-XXX-MS transect was run on XXX shells measuring the profiles of XX elements. The transect was positioned to include the region of the most recent growth on the shell.

We address two sets of  questions. First, which elements are associated with species, river, and/or sites? To what degree? Secondly, which elements are associated with morbidity/mortality in the Alasmidonta? The study design does not admit straightforward causal interpretations of the element’s effects. Taken together, however, our answers represent important contributions to scientific understanding of unionid physiology, ecological experiments, and … . They also lead us to propose hypotheses as to the decline of *A. raveneliana*.

The paper is organized as follows.

## LS-ICP-MS

Analyses were conducted at the University of Texas at Austin using an ESI New Wave Research NWR193 excimer laser coupled to an Agilent 7500ce ICP-MS. The laser system has a large format laser cell that enabled up to nine slides (30 valves) to be loaded with standards in a single drawer. Each slide was scanned at high resolution (4800 dpi) and optimal transects determined prior to loading each sample drawer. Once loaded the coordinates of each traverse were established in the laser experiment according to the digital scan maps. For analysis we surveyed a broad range of industrial metals, as well as bio-metals; specifically: Mg, Ca, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, As, Se, Kr (for Se interference correction if detected), Sr, Mo, Cd, Sn, Ba, Hg, Pb and U (n = 20). 

As youngest growth was of principal interest, we targeted growth parallel transects from the outer margins of valves, away from the umbo. For thicker valves we also analyzed additional offset scans to evaluate reproducibility and include older growth. In most cases, the entire preserved growth history was recorded by making multiple offset traverses (Figure \ref{}). Continuous lateral transects (edge to umbo) were performed within the outer prismatic layer of two valves. Most valves were on the order of 1 mm thick, but some ranged up to 3-4 mm. We used a 25$\mu$m spot and scanned at 5$\mu$m/sec. The quadrupole sampling interval was 0.5762, equating to readings each 2.88$\mu$m along the transect. All transects moved from the inner to the outer shell, parallel to the growth direction, beginning and ending in epoxy. The scans varied in terms of residing solely with the outer prismatic layer and periostracum, or being compound scans initiating in the nacreous layer. Each scan resulted in a chemical time-series for each analyte (concentration vs. distance; a matrix of ~7000 concentration measurements per mm). For data reduction we assumed a stoichiometric CaCO3 composition (40.0432 wt% Ca) and did not adjust for mineralogy (aragonite vs. calcite). We used USGS MACS-3 (synthetic aragonite) as the primary calibration standard, and analyzed NIST 614 (trace elements at ~1 ppm) and NIST 612 (trace elements at ~35 ppm). For drift compensation, each hour of data collection on unknowns was bracketed by analyses of each standard (in duplicate). 

## Data preparations

Each valve was prepared in a thin layer of epoxy, some data at the inner and outer edges of each transect measured elemental concentrations in epoxy rather than shell. From each edge, the beginning of valve was the minimum of 50 $\mu$m or the point at which $log_{10}(x + 1)$ of copper, lead and mercury were less than one. This criteria was based on inspection of plots of elemental concentrations. 

As many as four transects were ablated per valve. Using valve scans that included transect locations, one transect per valve was chosen so that all transects in the analyses would include the region of most recent growth for each valve. In total, XX transects were included (XX A. rav - XX Baseline, XX LiTN, XX Tuck; YY L. fas - YY Baseline, YY LiTN, YY Tuck).

The raw data and the code used to prepare data for analysis are available in the supplementary materials.

* differentiate that we used step-scanning (perpendicular to annual growth rings) vs fly-scanning [@shoults2014resolution]
* make sure to analyze the amount of data trimmed by epoxy algorithm and that this is evenly distributed across sites and dead/alive specimens. i.e., more or less data trimmed on dead specimens could indicate something different about those shells.

## Statistical Analyses

### Elements associated with river and/or site


Two inferential approaches were used to assess whether the trajectory of element accumulations varied across sites after specimens were randomized to the six sites. Both involve fitting cubic splines for each specimen’s transect per element. The first approach parameterizes a generalized additive model (GAM) to include site-level main effects for changes in the trajectory from a certain distance (in $\mu$m) from each edge, labeled $Z = \{Z_I, Z_O\}$ for the inner and outer edges. Figure \ref{fig:zpoint} illustrates $Z$ on a hypothetical transect.

\begin{figure}
\label{fig:zpoint}
\caption{A hypothetical transect showing $Z$ and how the $\delta$ parameters may shift the trajectory from $\mathbb{X}_I$ and $\mathbb{X}_O$ to its respective edge.}
\includegraphics{holder.png}
\end{figure}

Let $d_{I}$ and $d_{O}$ be the distance in $\mu$m from the corresponding (I)inner or (O)outer edge to an observation (Figure \ref{xpoint}). Let $Y^e_i$ be the vector of observations from specimen $i = 1, \dots, n$ and element $e$. Let $S_i$ be a specimen’s site (i.e. the experimental treatment). The following generalized additive model was fit per element:

\[
E[Y_i | L_i = l, b_i] = \mathbf{1}(S_i = l) \left[ \delta_{ZI} ((d_I - Z_{I}) * (d_I - Z_{I} <= 0)) +  \delta_{ZO} ((d_O - Z_{O}) * (d_O - Z_{O} <= 0)) \right] + f_i(d_I, k) + b_i.
\]

$\mathbf{1}(\cdot)$ is the indicator function. $f_i(d_{I})$ is a cubic spline term fit separately for each specimen with $k$ knots. DESCRIBE HOW K WAS CHOSEN. $b_i$ is an additional specimen-level random effect term. Tuck 1 specimens were used as the reference group, as the all of the $A. raveneliana* specimens were originally collected at a site between Tuck 1 and Tuck 2. 

The parameters of interest in this model are $\delta$, which represent linear site-level departures from the trajectory of Tuck 1 specimens beginning at $Z$.

In theory, $Z_I$ could be measured precisely on each valve using disturbance rings or other visual clues. In practice, this proved difficult, so instead we estimated $\delta$ using different values of $Z$. To compare sensitivity to the choice of $Z$, the above models were fit for $Z_{\cdot} = 25, 50, 100, 200$. A visual inspection of XX *A. raveneliana* valves showed that the average distance to the disturbance line was XXX, while in the *L. fasciola* it was XXX.

Confidence intervals for site-level effects are inferred from standard theory of GAM estimator asymptotics. However, due to the small samples in each site (Table \ref{table1})

Parameters were estimated using the `mgcv` R package [@wood2011fast].

* Model fit?
* Standard errors were obtained from sandwich type estimators? -- not sure how to do this?
* Include river main effects? and nest site within river?


The second approach uses randomization-based inference to obtain exact p-values based on changes in the trajectory from the $Z$ points. For each species, we consider the 5 pair-wise comparisons of Tuck 1 to each of the other sites, for ten different randomized experiments. Though in fact, there were ${12 \choose 6}$ possible combinations of how specimens could be assigned to either Tuck 1 or another site, we use only the specimens chosen as described above. That is, we consider ${c + t \choose c}$ possible treatment assignment where $c$ is the number of analysis Tuck 1 valves and $t$ is the number of analysis valves in the other site. Let $A = 0$ indicate that a valve was in Tuck 1, and $A = 1$ indicate the comparison site. 

\begin{table}[ht]
\label{tab:comparisons}
\caption{Tests of a hypothesis of no difference were made for each combination of the following comparisons.}
\begin{tabular}{lclc}
Type   & Comparison & Levels & Number \\
Between      & Experimental units & Tuck to LiTN; Baseline to Tuck; Baseline to LiTN; Baseline to each of 6 sites; Tuck1 to each of other 5 sites & 11 \\

Within       & Edge & Inner; Outer & 2 \\
Within       & $Z$ & 25, 50, 100, 200 & 4 \\
Total comparisons & & = 11 * 2 * 23 * 2 * 3 * ((3 * 2 * 4) + 1) = 75900 &
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

Let $\mathbf{Y}_i(a)$ be the specimen’s potential vector of element concentrations when the specimen is exposed to site $a$. 

* Most of this can probably go in a supplement.

The inferential process proceeds by considering various models and feature of these models for a transect’s vector of concentrations, $Y^e_i(a_i) = \mathcal{M}(f_i(d; k); \delta)$, where $f_i(d; k)$ is a valve-level cubic spline with $k$. Table \ref{tab:models} describes the various models used in the analysis. Each model parameterizes the possible effect of the experiment in a different manner.

\begin{table}
\centering
\label{tab:models}
\caption{Models considered}
\begin{tabular}{c|cc}
Label & Description & $\mathcal{M}$ \\
B & Shift in trajectory from point $Z$ to edge. $\delta$ represents a linear effect of the exposure between distances the edge and $Z$.  & $f_i(d; k) - \delta a (d - Z)[(d - Z) \leq 0]$ \\
BR & Shift in ratio of trajectory from after point $Z$ to edge relative to prior trajectory & TBD \\
M & Difference in average value from point $Z$ to edge & $f_i(d; k) - \delta a (d - Z)$ \\
S & Difference in total elemental accumulation across entire transect & $\frac{\sum_{id} f_i(d; k) - \delta a }{\sum d}$
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

Let $\Omega$ be the set of all possible treatment assignments. P-values testing the null hypothesis of no difference between the valves exposed to Tuck 1 (control) and each of the other sites were computed using randomization-based inference in the following way:

1. Fit cubic spline with $k$ knots to each valve series. 
2. For each valve, compute the slope from $Y - Y[Z]$ for x values $1, \dots, Z$, where $Y[Z]$ is the observed value at point $Z$. This slope is labeled $B_i$.
3. For each permutation of treatment assignment ($\mathbf{a} \in \Omega$), compute the test statistic: $(T(\mathbf{a}, \mathbf{F})$. For computational efficiency, when the cardinality of $\Omega$ was greater than 50,000, we randomly sampled 50,000 treatment assignments without replacement.
4. Compute the two-sided p-value:

\[
p = \frac{\sum_{\mathbf{a} \in \Omega} \ I(T(\mathbf{a}, \mathbf{F}) \geq T(\mathbf{A}, \mathbf{F}))}{|\Omega|}
\]


* control for multiple comparisons: control False discovery rate within what level?


### Elements associated with mortality and morbidity

Logistic regression models were used to measure the association of elemental concentrations with mortality among the *Alasmidonta*. For each element, the following model template was used: $\mbox{logit}^{-1}\{\Pr(Y = 1| S_{\mathcal{X} = s)} \} = \beta_0 + \beta_{1, \mathcal{X}, s} s_{\mathcal{X}}$. Three different summary statistics, $S_{\mathcal{X}} = s)$, of the trajectory between an edge and $\mathcal{X}$ were used: the mean, median, and slope. In sum, 48 $\beta_{1, \mathcal{X}, s}$ parameter estimate were obtained for each elements: four $\mathcal{X}$ distances, two edges, and three summary statistics. 

Comparison within A. rav:
* per element: logistic regression modeling Pr(dead | covariates) where covariate was each of mean or median within each of the 6 transect sections (plus entire transect)
* graphical comparison of summary statistics within transect sections for alive, moribund, dead.



# Results

Brief summary of results


## Elements associated with rivers and sites

Figure XX shows effect estimates and 9X% confidence intervals of the contrast of baseline to Tuck, baseline to LiTN, and Tuck to LiTN. 


## Elements associated with morbidity/mortality

Figure XX shows effect estimates from logistic regressions. Only elements with a statistically significant effect (or p < 0.1?) are shown; remaining are in Supplementary Materials.


# Discussion

We have shown that …

* XXX, YYY, and ZZZ appeared in greater concentration in LiTN valves. Notably, XXX has been shown to have physiological effect AAA, and so on for YYY and ZZZ.
*

* associations with morbidity/mortality are not causal effects. would be causal if...
* associations of elements and river/site do have causal interpretation under following assumptions <-- worth mentioning?


## Limitations

* discussion of cage effect
